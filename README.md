# Dino Nuggies: Dinosaurs and Modern Energy Analysis

Our project, "Dino Nuggies," ventures into the fascinating correlation between the locations of dinosaur fossils and the modern-day geographic distribution of fossil fuel production. We present an interactive set of plots that showcase the historical resting places of dinosaurs juxtaposed with current data on oil, coal, and gas production across various countries.

Our predictive plot for 2025, based on data from 2020 and the quantity of dinosaur bones found in each country, aims to provide an insightful forecast into the future of energy resources.

## Plots Overview

1. **Dinosaur Bone Distribution:** A map indicating the number of dinosaur bones found in each country.
2. **Oil Production Analysis:** A visualization of oil production quantities by country, compared to the dinosaur bone distribution.
3. **Bone and Oil Comparison:** Comparison between bone dinosaur bone distribution and oil production in each country.
4. **Predictive Oil Production Plot for 2025:** Using historical data and dinosaur bone discoveries, we extrapolate a predictive model for potential oilproduction in the year 2025.

## Conclusion

Our analysis leads to intriguing possibilities that tie the prehistoric past with our energy present and future. Stay tuned for our conclusion where we summarize our findings and provide insights into how these ancient patterns may influence modern energy landscapes.

## Future Directions

We plan to refine our predictive models further and expand our dataset to cover more geographical locations and historical data points. This will allow us to provide even more accurate forecasts and deeper insights into the connection between the prehistoric ecosystem and current energy sources.
